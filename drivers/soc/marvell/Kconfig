config OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE
	tristate "OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI Endpoint console driver"
	depends on ARM64 && PCI
	default n
	help
	  Select this option to enable the PCI console driver when
	  OcteonTX2/CN10K is configured as an Endpoint.  This allows the
	  host [PC] to connect to the Linux console via PCI
	  (using the host remote console utility).
	  To enable this console, specify 'console=pci0' on the kernel
	  command line.
	  To compile this as a module, choose M here.  However, when used
	  as a module, some kernel boot messages may be missing from the
	  console.

config OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE_DEBUG
	bool "OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI Endpoint console driver verbose debug messages"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI console driver
	  to write verbose debug messages to the system log.
	  Select this if you are having a problem with the OcteonTX2/CN10K
	  PCI console and want to see more details of the console's
	  operation.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

config OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE_TRACE
	bool "OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI Endpoint console driver trace messages"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE
	depends on DYNAMIC_FTRACE
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI console driver
	  to write verbose debug messages to the dynamic ftrace infrastructure.
	  Select this if you are having a problem with the OcteonTX2/CN10K PCI console
	  and want to see more details of the parts that are not debuggable
	  with traditional prints coming from OCTEONTX2_PCI_CONSOLE_DEBUG.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

config HW_CSR_ACCESS
	tristate "Access HW Device Config Space"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_AF
	default m
	help
	  provides an interface which enables user space utility to read from or to write
	  to HW Device Config Space Registers, Contexts, Memory.

config OCTEONTX_SERDES
	tristate "OcteonTX2 serdes debug commands"
	default m
	depends on ARM64 && HAVE_ARM_SMCCC && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Provides debugfs commands which allows to collect serdes information,
	  capture eye, use PRBS, configure serdes in loopback mode, and
	  read/write TX tuning parameters.

config MARVELL_CN10K_SERDES_DIAGNOSTICS
	tristate "Marvell SerDes diagnostics debugfs driver"
	default m
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable SerDes diagnostics
	  interface for performing PRBS, setting Loopback mode or
	  reading/writing Tx/Rx tuning parameters.
